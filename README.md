# Arcade Finder Australia
Summary: A website hosting information around arcades within Australia, including location, arcade cabinets featured, and cost per play.

Description: Aracde Finder Australia is a website intended to browse crowdsourced information on entertainment centres that focus on or feature arcade cabinets around Australia. Hereby, "Arcade(s)" will refer to these entertainment centres, and "Cab(s)" will refer to the actual arcade cabinets (games) themselves. 

The information included in this website is the actual location of the arcade itself, as well as the specific cabs they have (including the quantity of the same cab) and cost per play. This information will be gathered by myself as the creator of this website as well as providing the opportunity for members of the public to email me updated cab listings along with photographic evidence of their findings to keep the list as up-to-date as possible.

Some future features I wish to also include:

- Other features of the arcade (eg: If it is attached to a bowling venue, if there is a bar present, if it is attached to a laser tag venue etc...)
- If there is a VIP option or bonus credits awarded upon recharging certain amounts
- General condition of the cab
- Arcade cab search
- Crowdedness
- IC Card functionality enabled or disabled
- Opening and closing times of the arcade
- Reviews
- Summary of each cab


This project is a passion project of mine as I hate to see the decline of arcades and wish to do everything I can to show others some of the joys of arcades, the friends you can make, and the unique experiences only they can offer.

I may set up donations in the future idk
